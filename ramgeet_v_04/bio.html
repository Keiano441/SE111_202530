                <p>Hey dudes, it's Nisey. I honeslty just enjoy the simple things in life.
                   I'm pretty shy but once you get to know me ya might think i'm a crazy weirdo. I love chill days, deep convos, and laughing at dumb shit.
                   I'm from the Cayman Islands and I can't lie it is hard being out here at times because I litarally don't have anyone with me so some of my hobbies are ways I cope with my mental.
                   I'm usually lost in my own little world, I overthink a lot, feel things a bit too deeply, and sometime just shut down and don't leave my bed for a while,
                   but I always come back from it eventually. Anyways life's a mess, but I'm still here holding on to the little things that make it better.
                </p>
